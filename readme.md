## extras for review
changed the header typeface, Added svg logo to sidebar, changed main column to a 2 up layout vs. 3up. and i changed the buttons on the about page into a horizontal layout, updated my phone number to binary and changed type style.

I know some of these changes are on the edge as far as the scope of the CSS changes, but they really helped the layout.
